# Binary Search Challenge

**Author**: Jeffery John

## Description

Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.

Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!

## Challenge Files

You can download the challenge files here:

- [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_atlas/20/challenge.zip)

### SSH Access

The same files are accessible via SSH:

```bash
ssh -p 60268 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net
```

- Password: `6abf4a82`
- **Note**: When entering the password in the terminal, it will be hidden. Type it carefully and press Enter.
- After connecting, accept the SSH fingerprint by typing `yes` and then use the `ls` command to list the files in the directory.

## How to Solve

1. **Run the shell script:**
  ```bash	
    chmod +x guessing_game.sh
    ./guessing_game.sh
  ```

2. **Binary Search Approach:**
 
- The script will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 1000. You have 10 attempts to find the correct number using binary search.
- Binary search strategy: Always guess the middle of your current range to minimize guesses
  - Start by guessing 500 (middle of 1-1000).
  - If the correct answer is higher, guess halfway between 500 and 1000 (750).
  - If the answer is lower, guess halfway between 1 and 500 (250).
Repeat this process until you find the correct number.

3. **Extract the Flag:**

- Once you guess the correct number, the script will display the flag.
- The flag should follow the format picoCTF{...}.

## Tools You May Need

- **Bash shell**: If youâ€™re on Windows, you can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run the shell script, or use a Linux system natively.
