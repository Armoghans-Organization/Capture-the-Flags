## Introduction

This repository showcases my approach to solving different types of CTF challenges. Each solution includes a detailed explanation of the process, tools used, and the steps taken to crack the challenge. My goal is to document the learning process, help others understand CTF techniques, and continuously improve my own skills.

## Write-ups

You will find write-ups for various CTF challenges in the respective directories. Each folder is named after the challenge and contains all relevant details, including the methodology and tools used. Some challenges may include additional resources such as scripts or files for better understanding.

## How to Navigate

- **Folders**: Each CTF challenge is organized in a folder with the challenge name.
- **Write-ups**: The main solution or explanation can be found in the `README.md` within each folder.
- **Files**: Any related scripts, binaries, or data files used during the challenge will be included in the respective directories.

## Disclaimer

The solutions and techniques shared in this repository are for educational purposes only. Please use the knowledge gained responsibly and ensure that you follow ethical hacking guidelines.

## Future Plans

This repository will be updated regularly as I continue solving more CTF challenges. Future improvements and expansions will include:
- More categories of challenges (e.g., Web Exploitation, Cryptography, Forensics).
- In-depth analysis of tougher challenges.
- Additional resources and references for learning.

Stay tuned for updates!
